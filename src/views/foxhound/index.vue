                    <p class="mt-6 text-base leading-7 text-gray-600">Foxhounds were developed for hunting foxes and for hundreds of years, have been bred for use in packs. In Australia the Foxhound probably accompanied the captive foxes brought out by wealthier British settlers in the 1800s so they could ride to the hunt here, in memory of the lifestyle back "Home". Hunt packs still operate in most Australian states except WA and NT.</p>
                    <p class="mt-6 text-base leading-7 text-gray-600">The Foxhound is just a taller version of the Beagle, smooth-coated, with drop ears and  to have a keen sense of smell, and to be even faster in the chase. A large, handsome hound, its front legs are long and very straight-boned. The head is long with a slightly domed, large skull. The ears are broad and pendant, framing the face. The eyes are large and wide-set - either brown or hazel, with a sweet, imploring expression. The ears are wide, flat to the head. The tail is set moderately high with a slight upward curve, but is not turned forward over the back. </p>
